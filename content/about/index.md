Isabella:
I finished my yoga and meditation teacher training in Ireland 2017, since 2012 I study and practice also Tibetan Buddhism, I came to Poland with my partner Raphael to realise our dream of our own retreat centre.

Yoga, meditation and living in harmony with nature connect my holistic being, which finds balance in stillness.

Perma culture solutions, gardening, cooking vegetarian, backing, and process herbs into tea and ointment are just some components of my life next to my spiritual practice. Through mindfulness in all facets I canÂ´t distinguish between the one and the other.

Raphael is a student of Kum Nye in his yoga practice.

We both aspire to start our own meditation center and live with permaculture principles.
