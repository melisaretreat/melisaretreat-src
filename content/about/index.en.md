# Isabella

I started practicing Yoga with age 19 and through my regular practice I came in touch with meditation also. Different teachers and influences accompanied my path.

[My first yoga studio](http://www.pranayoga.at/) I visited in Vienna and I can still highly recommend it.

Adelheid Ohlig who created [Luna Yoga](https://luna-yogaweg.at/). Here I discovered the power of Yoga in the female form. I learnt a lot with Gyöngyi in Vienna.

In Ireland I completed my teacher training in 2017 and since then I teach on a regular basis. [Noeleen Tyrrell](https://www.ardnahoo.com/) offereda new energetic way with Anusara Yoga.

The gentle side of body movement I experienced with Somatic Yoga and [Lisa Petersen](https://lisapetersen.yoga/).

In [Jampa Ling](www.jampaling.org), the Tibetan Buddhist center in Ireland, I have practiced meditation and studied buddhism for years. Also, I have worked as a housekeeper and yoga teacher in the center.
If you like to support the center in any way, you can [donate here](https://www.jampaling.org/about-us/support-jampa-ling/).

Another project I treasure and volunteered for is [Projekt Ruanda](https://www.projekt-ruanda-erika-hronicek.at/).

During my stay in Jampa Ling in Ireland, I had the idea of opening a retreat center in Poland. Now we are here to make it happen.

I’ve learned Kum Nye Yoga in Dzogchen Beara, and I’ve deepened my meditation practice in Jampa Ling.

# Future Plans

We'd like to invite people with special skills like healers, high sensitive beings and all these, who are overwhelmed by the modern world and create a retreat area. We would like to offer a solution for the individual seeker of peace in a small setting.

Yurts, simple but comfortable furnished, give the choice to live short or long term in a small community. It is possible to meditate, eat and work together. Also, it is important to experience relaxation and find stillness in us.

The solitary yurts can provide self-catering options. There are different ways of cultivating a solitary retreat, and we can help to organize a daily routine.
