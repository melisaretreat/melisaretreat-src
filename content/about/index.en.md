We seek to live in harmony on our homestead. We completely avoid alcohol, drugs, cigarettes and the consumption of meat in our home, and we kindly ask our visitors to do the same. In the same way we encourage a friendly approach in speech and action. Not to curse or yell at each other but to be open and receptive for new situations. To avoid lying for your own advantage. We are able to discuss everything but without using harsh words. These are a few examples of how we communicate on a day to day basis.

We live a minimalist lifestyle, and we are frugal in our financial decisions. In that way we can avoid bank loans and contact with investors. This gives us the freedom to develop the center in a beneficial way and we are independent of outside pressure.

## Future Plans
Firstly we're planning to build yurts, renting to anyone who wishes to spend solitary time, for spiritual practices, arts, or just highly focused work.

Also, we like to invite people with special skills like healers, high sensitive beings, people in the autistic spectrum and all these, who are overwhelmed by the modern world and create a retreat area. We would like to offer a solution for the individual seeker of peace in a small setting.

Yurts, simple but comfortable furnished, give the choice to live short or long term in a small community. It is possible to meditate, eat and work together. Also, it is important to experience relaxation and find stillness in us.

The solitary yurts can provide self-catering options. There are different ways of cultivating a solitary retreat, and we can help to organize a daily routine.

## Melisa â€“ the name says it all

Melisse (German), lemon balm (English), melisa (Polish), melissa officinalis (Latin)
is often used as a herbal infusion to help find relaxation and comfort. We try to offer the same concept with our community and the retreat.
