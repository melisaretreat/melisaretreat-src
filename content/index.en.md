# Isabella

I started practicing Yoga with age 19 and through my regular practice I came in touch with meditation also. Different teachers and influences accompanied my path.

[My first yoga studio](http://www.pranayoga.at/) I visited in Vienna and I can still highly recommend it.

Adelheid Ohlig who created [Luna Yoga](https://luna-yogaweg.at/). Here I discovered the power of Yoga in the female form. I learnt a lot with Gyöngyi in Vienna.

In Ireland I completed my teacher training in 2017 and since then I teach on a regular basis. [Noeleen Tyrrell](https://www.ardnahoo.com/) offereda new energetic way with Anusara Yoga.

The gentle side of body movement I experienced with Somatic Yoga and [Lisa Petersen](https://lisapetersen.yoga/).

In [Jampa Ling](www.jampaling.org), the Tibetan Buddhist center in Ireland, I have practiced meditation and studied buddhism for years. Also, I have worked as a housekeeper and yoga teacher in the center.
If you like to support the center in any way, you can [donate here](https://www.jampaling.org/about-us/support-jampa-ling/).

Another project I treasure and volunteered for is [Projekt Ruanda](https://www.projekt-ruanda-erika-hronicek.at/).

I’ve learned Kum Nye Yoga in Dzogchen Beara, and I’ve deepened my meditation practice in Jampa Ling.
