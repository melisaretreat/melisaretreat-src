We would like to create a place which will give us the opportunity to form our life in the right way
for us. Spirituality and ethics will lead our direction.

Also we like to invite people with special skills like healers, high sensitive beings, people in the
autistic spectrum and all these, who are overwhelmed by the modern world in our retreat which we
like to create like an oasis. Often, we find just the possibilities of a conventional holiday in a hotel or
a retreat in a Yoga Centre. We would like to offer a solution for the individual seeker of peace in a
small setting.

Yurts, simple but comfortable furnished, give the choice to live short or long term in a small
community. It is possibly to meditate, eat and work together. Also, it is important to experience
relaxation and find stillness in us.

The solitary yurts can provide self-catering options. There are different ways of cultivating a solitary
retreat and we can help to organize a daily routine.

Our opinion includes perma culture solutions to recognise our true self. Only through quietness and
surrounded by nature we can develop in a spiritual way.
